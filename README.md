# qEuler
Solutions to the project euler problems in q.

The project Euler webiste (https://projecteuler.net/about) contains a list of programming
problems and solutions in different languages. The aim of this repository is to provide
solutions to the problems in q, given then lack of solutions available currently.

Please use only q code; no system calls or other languages (also no k). The aim is to
provide the most efficient (in terms of memory and cpu usage) solution for each problem.

Please also put whitespace and newlines in your code to make it readable, and add comments
to describe what your code does.
